# Inventory App (Laravel JSON Submission)

A mini Laravel app to add products via a form, save them to a JSON file, and display them in a table with total calculations. Includes bonus: edit feature via Bootstrap modal.


If `php artisan serve` fails:
```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8888 -t public
```
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8888
