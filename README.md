# Inventory App (Laravel JSON Submission)

A mini Laravel app to add products via a form, save them to a JSON file, and display them in a table with total calculations. Includes bonus: edit feature via Bootstrap modal.


If `php artisan serve` fails:
```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8888 -t public
```
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8888

hey coalition tech team,

thanks a lot for taking the time to check out my submission. i really enjoyed building this little project, esp the edit feature with json and modals (took me a bit to get it working right lol). i tried to keep things simple and readable, and hope it aligns with what you were looking for.

i‚Äôd be super grateful if you could consider me for the interview round. i'm genuinely interested in the work coalition does and would love to be part of the team. really hoping this submission shows a bit of my effort and enthusiasm üôè

cheers,
